# Demand-Forecasting
The company holds warehouses in various cities across the country. Different items are sent to these warehouses on a weekly basis and from where they are distributed to various small stores on a daily basis. To increase the efficiency of this process, the management has decided to build software that can forecast weekly and daily demand in advance.
